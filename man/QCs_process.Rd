  sep_QC = FALSE,
  QC_to_merge = NULL,
  step1 = TRUE,
  step1_cutoff = 30,
  step2 = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{featmatrix}{a dataframe of feature intensities. The first column should contain the feature name, each other columns should be related to an analysis of a sample and contains the feature intensities.}

\item{sampletype}{a dataframe containing two or three columns: the first one contains the name of samples reported in the featmatrix. The second column contains, for each sample, one of the following: "REMOVE", for samples to be discharged; "blank", for blank samples; "QC", for pooled quality control samples; "QC_half", for pooled quality control samples diluted by a half; "unknown", for other samples. The third column should contain the sample category that will be considered if sep_QC is TRUE.}

\item{sep_QC}{logical. If TRUE, separate QC filtration will be performed. For more details check: Frigerio et al. 2022 https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27082580.}

\item{QC_to_merge}{charter vector. If sep_QC is TRUE, it should contain the names of all the groups of pooled QC samples to consider for the final merge of the filtered features}

\item{step1}{logical. Whether to discharge features above a certain relative standard deviation percentage (RSD\%) of QCs, defined by step1_cutoff}

\item{step1_cutoff}{numeric of length 1. If step1 is TRUE, features with a RSD\% of QCs above this value will be considered not suitable.}

\item{step2}{logical. Whether to discharge features below a certain QCs count\%, defined by step2_cutoff.}

\item{step2_cutoff}{numeric of length 1. If step2 is TRUE, features with valid values (not NA) in less than a percentage of QCs specified in this value will be considered not suitable.}

\item{step3}{logical. Whether to discharge features above a certain blank contribution\%, defined by step3_cutoff.}

\item{step3_cutoff}{numeric of length 1. If step3 is TRUE, features with a blank contribution \% (calculated as mean blank/mean QCs*100) higher that this value, will be considered not suitable.}

\item{step4}{logical. Whether to discharge features not included in a certain range comparing QCs with the QC_half, defined by step4_cutoff.}

\item{step4_cutoff}{numeric of length 2. If step4 is TRUE,features that in the QC_half are not within this percentage range comapred to QCs will be considered not suitable.}

\item{rtrn_filtered_table}{logical. if TRUE returns the filtered table, if FALSE returns the non-filtered table (useful only if you want to check the parameters such as QC CV\% or blank contribution in the features that would be filtered)}

\item{remove_results}{logical. If TRUE, returns the table of features, if FALSE, the last columns will report the results such as QC CV\% and blank contribution}

\item{remove_QC_and_blanks}{logical. At the end of the processing, if TRUE it will remove columns containing QCs and blanks (so, if also remove_results is TRUE and rtrn_filtered_table is TRUE, at the end you will have a great table of feature intensities with only samples ready for the next processing)}

\value{
a tibble with the feature intensities as result of the QC processing

\description{
Given a dataframe with feature intensities from a non-targeted experiment and another dataframe containing information about sample types, it filters the dataframe of feature intensities  considering some defined cut-off in the quality control samples.
