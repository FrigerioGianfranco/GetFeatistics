\title{Get a table of feature intensities from the MSDIAL export file.}
\usage{
get_feat_table_from_MSDial(
  MSDIAL_raw_table = NULL,
  MSDIAL_raw_table_file_name = NULL,
  n_last_coloums_to_delete = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSDIAL_raw_table}{NULL or a dataframe. Load on R the exported table using write_tsv or write_csv, then directly pass it in this argument. This argument will be ignored if the following one is not NULL.}

\item{MSDIAL_raw_table_file_name}{NULL or a character vector of length 1. The name of the .txt file of the MSDIAL exported table to import. It is preferred to use this argument instead of the previous, so the table will be also imported with the correct column types and information.}

\item{n_last_coloums_to_delete}{numeric of length 1. Usually in the exported file from MSDIAL, the last columns are for descriptive statistics of the features. Pass here the number of the last columns that you need to remove.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the feature intensities.
}
\description{
Given a table exported from MSDIAL (exporting the Area from MS-Dial 5.1.230912), it creates a table with only the name of features in the first column (same names created in the one of the featINFO) and the intensities of features in each other column.
